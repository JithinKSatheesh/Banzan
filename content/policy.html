                    <br>
                    We take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect against unauthorized access to
                    or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Information and Account Information. These
                    include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security
                    measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
                    unauthorized access to systems where we store Account Information and Information. We have an
                    information security program and information security policies which contain managerial, technical,
                    operational, and physical security control measures adopted by us for that purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    We strive to keep utmost importance to data security with our hosting and such other third party
                    service providers. We shall ensure regular checks to identify any potential breach or risk and in
                    such event, you, the user, shall be notified immediately for necessary action.
                    <br><br>
                    While we would be taking appropriate measures to protect the security of Account Information and
                    Information, please do note that we do not guarantee absolute protection from security breach.
                    Further, data which is transmitted over the Internet is inherently exposed to security risks or
                    threats. Therefore, we also cannot guarantee any security for such information in the course of
                    transmission through the internet infrastructure or any unsolicited disclosures made by any user
                    availing the Services.
                    <br><br>
                    You are advised that if you become aware or suspect of or reasonably suspect any breach of security,
                    including compromise of your Account Information, it is your responsibility to immediately notify
                    us.

                    fulfil the purposes for which such information is collected, as outlined in this Privacy Policy,
                    subject to such longer time periods of retention as may be required under any applicable laws.
